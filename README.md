## Project Description

### 5 Semantic Harmony Social Network

Design and develop a social network based on the user‚Äôs interests that exploits a P2P Network. The system collects the profiles of the users and automatically creates friendships according to a matching strategy. The users can see their friends over time and are automatically informed when a user enters the social network and becomes a new potential friend. The system defines a set of questions, for instance, if the user like or not like a set of photos, a set of a hashtag, or more accurate as Big Five Personality Test.

At this point, the system can compute the user scoring according to the answers. This scoring is elaborated by a matching strategy that automatically finds out the friends. Consider, for instance, a binary answers vector; a matching process should be the difference in 0 and 1, or the Hamming distance, and so on. The system allows the users to see the social network questions, create a profile score according to the answer, join in the network using a nickname, and eventually see all user friends. As described in the [SemanticHarmonySocialNetwork](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/distributedsystems_class_2020/blob/master/homework/SemanticHarmonySocialNetwork.java) Java API.
