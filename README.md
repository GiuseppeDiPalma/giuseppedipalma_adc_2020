## Project Description

### Semantic Harmony Social Network

Design and develop a social network based on the user‚Äôs interests that exploits a P2P Network. The system collects the profiles of the users and automatically creates friendships according to a matching strategy. The users can see their friends over time and are automatically informed when a user enters the social network and becomes a new potential friend. The system defines a set of questions, for instance, if the user like or not like a set of photos, a set of a hashtag, or more accurate as Big Five Personality Test.

At this point, the system can compute the user scoring according to the answers. This scoring is elaborated by a matching strategy that automatically finds out the friends. Consider, for instance, a binary answers vector; a matching process should be the difference in 0 and 1, or the Hamming distance, and so on. The system allows the users to see the social network questions, create a profile score according to the answer, join in the network using a nickname, and eventually see all user friends. As described in the [SemanticHarmonySocialNetwork](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/distributedsystems_class_2020/blob/master/homework/SemanticHarmonySocialNetwork.java) Java API.

#### Proposed solution

My personal solution has been developed on the basis of the indications given above. The first time you log on to the social network you are asked a series of questions(10) which you can answer with a grade from 1 (little agree) to 5 (very agree). At the end we will have a personal sequence of answers for each user.

Later this sequence was expanded with a random string of 5 characters (just to increase the randomness).
As soon as users become two or more, a check is made to see if two people have the same interests.

This calculation is done using the algorithm [LCS(longest common subsequence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem).
If the LCS distance value is <= 5 then there is friendship

This solution provides for the following actions:

- Join the network;
- Search for users;
- Show all users on network;
- Associate people with the same interests;
- Exit the network.

#### Solution structure

- `public List<String> getUserProfileQuestions()`: This method provides a list of questions (consisting in strings).
- `public String createAuserProfileKey(List<Integer> _answer)`: This method deals with a key. This key is composed by a 10 number (1 to 5) end 5 character (A to Z). Example: 2311114415LBCSE 2133342331WXPSI.
- `public boolean join(String _profile_key, String _nick_name)`: This function allows user to join in the network.
- `public List<String> getFriends()`: This method provides a list of the user's friends on the network. A random but not too random method was used. Using the two keys provided above, their LCS is calculated. If this value is equal to or less than 5, the two users will be added to their friend lists.

##### Specific functions

- `public static String generateRandomString()`: Generate random string of 5 characters, A to Z.
- `static int LCSDistance(String X, String Y)`: Longest common subsequence, finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).

#### JUnit tests

- `void checkSendNotification()`: check if a notification has actually been sent.
- `void checkJoinInNetwork()`: check whether you have successfully joined the network.
- `void checkPeerObj()`: checks whether users who have actually logged in are available in the social.
- `void checkFriendship()`:  this test provides to check if the two userProfileKey are major minor or equal of a given threshold and thus in the case it establishes the friendship relationship between two users.
- `void checkExitFromNetwork()`: checks whether the exit from the network was successful.
- `void checkRetriveUserFromSearch()`: checks whether the search for a user, succeeds in finding the user.

### Final considerations and conclusion

This project was interesting. Of course the functionalities implemented are minimal, but they have helped me to understand how to manage and implement a p2p network and how to solve any problems that may exist.

## Usage and how-to to test

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t socialnetworkp2p .
```

Run master-peer:

```bash
docker run -i --name MASTER-PEER -e MASTERIP="127.0.0.1" -e ID=0 socialnetworkp2p
```

Take CONTAINER ID:

```bash
docker ps
```

Take ADDRESS-IP of container:

```bash
docker inspect <MASTER PEER ID>
```

Start other peer:

```bash
docker run -i --name PEER-1 -e MASTERIP="172.17.0.2" -e ID=1 socialnetworkp2p
docker run -i --name PEER-2 -e MASTERIP="172.17.0.2" -e ID=2 socialnetworkp2p
docker run -i --name PEER-3 -e MASTERIP="172.17.0.2" -e ID=3 socialnetworkp2p
```

#### Build with

- Maven: **4.0.0**
- Java: **14.0**
